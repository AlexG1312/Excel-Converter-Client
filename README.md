In case the API application runs on a different url than "https://localhost:7199", you will have to change the URL in the src/config.js file.

Preferably have node 20 installed.

In order to run the application you will have to run the following commands:
    "npm install" - if this doesn't work you can use the --force flag if running for the first time
    "npm run start" - to launch the application at "http://localhost:3000"
